# NEMO/ELMO

NEMO/ELMO is a mobile data collection and analysis web application. Originally designed for the [Carter Center](http://www.cartercenter.org) for election observation missions, it can be used in many different contexts for data collection.

Consider NEMO/ELMO if you need:

- Integrated form design
- Standardized form sets
- Multiple data entry paths, including web, ODK Collect, and SMS
- Multiple mission/project management
- Advanced user management with multiple permission levels
- SMS broadcasting
- Custom, real-time reporting
- Offline operation in poorly-connected areas

To learn more about the history and goals of the project, [visit the project site](http://getnemo.org).
You can also learn more about The Carter Center's Election Standards [here](http://cartercenter.org).

## Production Setup

For production scenarios, [Sassafras Tech Collective](http://sassafras.coop) offers managed production instances. Contact them for details. Or you can follow the [production setup guide](docs/production-setup.md) to setup an instance on an Ubuntu server.

## Contributing

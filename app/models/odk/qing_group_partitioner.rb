# Separates a qing group that contains multilevel questionings into several groups.
# The idea here is to just remove the multilevel questioning from the group and create a QingGroupFragment
# for each level of the multilevel questioning, since ODK doesn't show multilevel questions correctly
# if they're part of a one-screen group.
#
# Input:
#  QingGroup qgroup
#     with children: Qing1, Qing2, MultilevelQing, Qing3
# Output:
#  [ QingGroupFragment with children Qing1 and Qing2,
#    QingGroupFragment with child MultilevelQing, level 1
#    QingGroupFragment with child MultilevelQing, level 2
#    QingGroupFragment with child MultilevelQing, level 3
#    QingGroupFragment with child Qing3
#   ]
# or nil if the group does not need partitioning.
#
# A group doesn't need to be partitioned if
# - It's not a one-screen group
# - It has only one question (in this case, if it's a multilevel question, it will get rendered
#   on separate screens)
# - It has any group children (in this case, we don't allow rendering the group on one screen)
# - It doesn't have any multilevel children
# - It is a QingGroupFragment (already meet the criteria above, by definition)

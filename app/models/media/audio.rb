    # A note on validation:
    # We no longer validate file extensions because we can't anticipate what extensions folks
    # will be sending from ODK Collect (since the platform changes over time)
    # and there is no easy way to allow the user to correct behavior on validation fail-we just have to
    # discard the file. So for that we reason we limit to mime type validation only since that still
    # provides some security but is less restrictive and less superficial.

    # For some reason, the mime-magic gem returns video/ogg for audio OGG files. Same for WEBM.

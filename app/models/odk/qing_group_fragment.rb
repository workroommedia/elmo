module Odk
  # This class is used to represent a fragment of a QingGroup.
  # ODK has issues showing a multilevel question inside a group,
  # so we split up a group that has a multilevel question on it
  # and remove it from the group to send it for ODK.
  #
  # Instances of this hold the other questions on the group that
  # weren't a multilevel question.
  #
  # See QingGroupOdkPartitioner for more details.

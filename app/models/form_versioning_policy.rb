# Implements the policy about when a form's version should be upgraded.
# Any form component objects (Option, OptionSet, OptionNode, Question, Questioning)
# should call this class after updating.
# It will tell the appropriate Forms to upgrade their versions.
#
# The goal of this policy is to provide some granularity over when downloading a new form is required.
# If we add a non-required question to the end of a form, it might not be necessary for everyone to
# re-download the form, for instance. If we add a required question, on the other hand, it is.

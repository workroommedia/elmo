# NEMO Development Setup

### Package managers

Note to install the software below we recommend the following package managers:

- Mac OS X: Homebrew
- Linux/Unix: bundled package manager (e.g. apt-get, yum)

### Required software

1. Ruby
    - Use of [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is recommended.
    - Running `rbenv install` in the project root will install the version you need.
    - If not using `rbenv`, see the `.ruby-version` file in the project root to get the required version number.
    - Bundler is expected to be available.  Run `gem install bundler` to install it.
1. Node
    - Use of [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) is recommended.
    - Running `nvm install` in the project root will install the version you need.
    - Note that `nvm` does NOT shim Node executables so `nvm use` is required to load the right Node versions in each new shell session.
    - If not using `nvm`, see the `.nvmrc` file in the project root to get the required version number.
    - The `yarn` Node module is expected to be installed globally.  Run `npm install -g yarn` to install it.
1. Memcached 1.4+
    - For development environments, caching is only needed if you are developing a feature that uses caching and want to test it.
    - In this case, be sure to increase the default slab page size to 2 MB. This is done by passing `-I 2m` to the `memcached` command.
1. PostgreSQL 10+
    - Create empty databases for use by the app: `createdb nemo_development && createdb nemo_test`
1. ImageMagick 6.7+
    - ImageMagick is used to resize uploaded images.
    - It should be available through any of the package managers listed above. If not it can be built from source.
1. Chrome (Browser) 60+
    - Used for automated browser testing.
1. Chromedriver 2.35+
    - Handles running Chrome headlessly for feature specs.
    - It should be available through any of the package managers listed above. If not it can be built from source.
    - The Rails Gem that talks to Chromedriver is called `selenium-webdriver`.
1. GraphViz 2.36+
    - [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) is used to visualize the relationships between data in the database.

### Linters

Linters are strongly recommended for checking your code before opening a PR. The CI system will run linters as well and your PR won't be approved until all issues are resolved or cancelled by the reviewer.

#### Setup

The below assume you have installed the Ruby and Node versions specified in `.ruby-version` and `.nvmrc` files, respectively.

Once you have `nvm` and Node installed, the following lines should give you all the required linters:

```
nvm use
npm install -g coffeelint@2.1.0
npm install -g eslint@4.17.0
npm install -g eslint-plugin-react@7.7.0
gem install rubocop -v 0.52.0
gem install scss_lint -v 0.56.0
```

#### Running

To lint your code, simply run:

```
bin/lint
```

This will examine any modified or untracked files in your working copy.

To instead examine any new or modified files in your branch (not including uncommitted changes), run:

```
bin/lint --branch
```

The latter should be run before opening a pull request.

As part of an effort to clean up old code, you should try to resolve any linter errors in files you touch, unless there are an overwhelming number of them. At bare minimum, the _lines_ you touch should not have any lint.

#### Tools

Most code editors have plugins for linting. They will identify and let you click directly into problematic lines. You are encouraged to try one out!

For Atom, install the `linter` package which contains shared stuff, then:

* `linter-eslint`
    * For this one, set your Global Node Installation Path and check the 'Use global ESLint installation' box.
* `linter-coffeelint`
* `linter-rubocop`
* `linter-scss-lint`

### Running the app

#### Retrieve project files using Git

```
git clone https://github.com/thecartercenter/nemo.git
cd nemo
```

If developing, it's best to work off the development branch:

```
git checkout develop
```

#### Bundle, configure, and load schema

1. Install the required gems by running `bundle install` in the project directory.
1. Install the required Node modules by running `yarn install` in the project directory.
1. Run `cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml`.
1. Run `cp config/settings.local.yml.example config/settings.local.yml` and adjust settings as appropriate.
1. Run `cp config/initializers/local_config.rb.example config/initializers/local_config.rb` and adjust settings as appropriate. Note that the reCAPTCHA and Google Maps API Key must be valid keys for those services in order for tests to pass.
1. Setup the UUID postgres extension:
    1. On Linux: `sudo -u postgres psql nemo_development -c 'CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"'`
    1. On Mac with Homebrew: `psql nemo_development -c 'CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"'`
1. Load the database schema: `bundle exec rake db:schema:load`.
1. Pre-process the theme SCSS files: `bundle exec rake theme:preprocess`
1. Create an admin account: `bundle exec rake db:create_admin`. You should receive a message like this: "Admin user created with username admin, password hTyWc9Q6" (The password is random, copy it and use on your first login).
1. Optionally, you can create some fake data to get things rolling by running `bundle exec rake db:create_fake_data`.

#### Run the tests

1. Run `nvm use` to ensure you have the right version of Node.js loaded. Do this once per console session.
1. Run `rspec`.
1. All tests should pass. Running them takes about 10-15 minutes.
1. If you have trouble debugging a feature spec, you can run it headed (so you can watch the browser go through the spec) by doing `HEADED=1 bundle exec rspec spec/features/your_spec.rb`.

#### Start the server

For a development setup, run `nvm use && rails s`.
You may want to run `bundle exec rake db:create_fake_data` to create a sample mission.

#### Login

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
1. Login with username **admin** and use the random password that was generated when you ran `bundle exec rake db:create_admin` (make sure to change the password after login).
1. Create a new Mission and get started making forms!

### Testing with ODK

1. Download the ODK application onto your Android phone or tablet
    - https://opendatakit.org/
1. Configure your rails development server so ODK can find it
    - Run `rails s -p 8443 -b 0.0.0.0`
1. Create a user and password
1. Publish your form in NEMO
1. Point the ODK app to your development server
    - In ODK, go to `General Settings > Platform Settings > URL`
    - For the URL put: `http://YOURIP:8443/m/yourmission`
    - Also put in your username and password
1. Retrieve Form
    - In ODK, you should now be able to go to `Get Blank Form` to download the forms from NEMO
